# netbang

Scrappy network interrogator and wringer-outer written in Go. Result of wondering aloud how much advantage Go's concurrency might give for network scanning of all kinds. Works really well, so kept adding features until, well here we are LOL. The things added are both standard fare, and stuff I'd always either hacked into other products or just dreamed about having.    
     
**Secondary goal:** *Create solutions for the challenge of the vastness of ipv6: networks with vanishingly few realistic limits anymore; there are increasingly so many things, we can't realistically plan to scan just every-fuckin-thing A-Z anymore. We'll never have enough time (ever). Get smart about it.*     
**Tertiary goal:** Use this as an opportunity to explore and decide what value, if any, scanning might still hold. And what changes should be made if it does happen to still be useful?    
      
Just rethinking possibilities and features as I go; not to mention interesting features mashup, foo breakage for fun and profit, other creative/educational mayhem. How many network layers can we make this thing blow apart and report upon?
