# netscanx
*(net-SKANKZ)*

Network scanner written in Go, by Chuck Geigner. This is mostly done as a result of wondering if Go's concurrency gives us some advantages for scanning. Might try true multithreading next, but why not get some mileage out of the bargain-basement thing first?
Secondary goal: rewriting from scratch makes me rethink possibilities, enhancements, and features; also want to be thinking about features, capabilities, opportunities for features mashup, breaking things for fun and profit, and other creative/educational mayhem
