# netscanx
*(net-SKANKZ)*

Scrappy network interrogator and wringer-outer written in Go. Result of wondering aloud how much advantage Go's concurrency might give for network scanning of all kinds. Might try true multithreading next, but why not get some mileage out of the cheap thing first?
Secondary goal: Rethinking possibilities and features as I go; not to mention interesting features mashup, foo breakage for fun and profit, other creative/educational mayhem. How many network layers can we make this thing blow apart and report upon?
